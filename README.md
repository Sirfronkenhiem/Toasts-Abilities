# **Description**
A data pack that adds 7 different custom abilities, each with a ability, ultimate and a passive to improve combat. They are: 
- Wind
- Electric
- Space
- Sculk
- Life
- Metal
- Oceanic

To use the ability you **MUST** have selectect that class before hand and it is only **ONE PERSON PER CLASS**

# **Recommended**
I recommend using a mod called command keys to rebind the functions you want to keybinds of your choice

Thanks for checking out my data pack and I hope you enjoy! :)
